# telecom-usage-forecasting-churn-prediction-
Telecom usage forecasting and churn prediction system using machine learning to analyze customer behavior, predict next-month data usage, and identify high-risk churn customers for targeted retention strategies.

# Telecom Network – Customer Usage Forecasting & Churn Risk Classification

## Overview
This project builds a data-driven system to forecast next-month customer
data usage and classify churn risk for a telecom company using machine
learning models.

## Objectives
- Predict next-month data usage using historical behavior
- Identify customers likely to churn
- Analyze key behavioral factors influencing churn
- Provide actionable insights for retention strategies

## Models Used
- Linear Regression (Usage Forecasting)
- Support Vector Machine (Churn Classification)
- XGBoost (Churn Classification – Advanced)

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn
