# Project Workflow

1. Data loading and cleaning
2. Feature engineering (One-hot encoding)
3. Train-test split
4. Regression modeling (usage forecasting)
5. Classification modeling (churn prediction)
6. Model evaluation
7. Visualization of results
8. Saving outputs and plots

This workflow mirrors a real-world ML pipeline.
