# Model Explanation

## 1. Linear Regression
Used to predict customer data usage for the next month.

### Why Linear Regression?
- Simple and interpretable
- Works well for continuous targets
- Provides explainable coefficients

### Evaluation Metrics
- MAE
- MSE
- RMSE
- R² Score

---

## 2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Used to predict customer churn.

### Why SVM?
- Effective in high-dimensional spaces
- Handles non-linear decision boundaries
- Robust to overfitting with proper regularization

### Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix

### Visualization
- TruncatedSVD used to reduce features to 2D
- Decision boundary plotted for interpretability
